# Amazon_products
We used Playwright to scrape Amazon, as it handles JavaScript and avoids blocks like CAPTCHA, IP bans, and user-agent checks. The HTML content was parsed using BeautifulSoup to extract product info like name, price, and image. The data was then saved to Google Sheets via the Sheets API using a service account.
